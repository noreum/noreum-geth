Overview
Noreum-geth is the official Execution Layer (EL) client of the Noreum Mainnet —
a modern, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain built from a deeply audited and refactored fork of go-ethereum (Geth).

This client powers the Noreum network’s core execution logic, ensuring stability, speed, and compatibility with decentralized consensus clients such as noreum-beacon (fork of Prysm).
