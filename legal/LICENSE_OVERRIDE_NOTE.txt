1. BASE LICENSE (UPSTREAM)
   This project derives portions of its source code from:
     - go-ethereum (Geth)
       Licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)
       © 2013–2025 The go-ethereum Authors

2. NOREUM LICENSE POLICY
   Modifications, reengineering, and all new code introduced under the
   "Noreum" namespace are distributed under the GNU General Public License
   v3.0 (GPL-3.0).

   The GPL license applies to all Noreum-specific modules, build scripts,
   configuration files, and manifests.

3. COMPATIBILITY STATEMENT
   The combination of LGPL-3.0 (from Geth) and GPL-3.0 (from Noreum)
   is legally compatible, as the GPL-3.0 satisfies the LGPL’s derivative
   licensing requirements (Section 3 of the LGPL).

   This ensures:
     - Legal redistribution of binaries and modified versions
     - Preservation of open-source guarantees
     - Full acknowledgment of upstream authorship

4. PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION
   - Any external contributor merging code into this repository implicitly
     agrees to release their contributions under GPL-3.0.
   - The resulting binaries and libraries (e.g., noreum-geth) are therefore
     covered by GPL-3.0.
   - All attributions to Geth and its authors are retained and visible in
     NOTICE.txt.
